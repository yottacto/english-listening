## How Artificial Intelligence is Powering the US Open

1. The crowds arrive daily at Flushing Meadows Park in Queens.
2. It's the US Open and all eyes are on the top tennis players in the world.
3. With 254 matches just in the men's and women's singles tournaments, it's a lot to keep up with,
4. but behind the scenes, IBM technology is doing just that.
5. So this gets updated at the end of that points. We see how Watson evaluate at that point.
6. With so much data to sort through, IBM is employing its artificial intelligence software Watson to help.
7. In addition to delivering scores, Watson also scans game footage. It listens to the roar of the crowd.
8. We've trained it to look for fist pumps and gestures of the players as well as to look for facial expressions.
9. All of that contextual data is used to measure the momentum of any given match in update fans after each shot.
10. A few years ago, we didn't;t really perceive video as data, but it really is.
11. There's 17 courts, so it's a lot of action, it's a lot of video for the editors to digest.
12. so now that you can quickly identify the most exciting moments and turn it around in near real time for fans.
13. These highlights aren't just for fans. Coaches also use them to prepare players.
14. In the past, it was a really labor-intensive process where the matches had to be manually tagged.
15. and by tagging, I mean somebody goes through the video footage and makes a note of every forehand, every backhand, every unforced error.
16. It takes hours and hours. Watson's artificial intelligence processes and indexes video in minutes, freeing up valuable time for personalized coaching.
17. If the coach has a certain pattern in mind that they think will be effective in the next match,
18. we can generate a playlist that shows the player executing those patterns and really reinforce and ingrain that in their mind.
19. Player's facial expressions and body language can also be correlated to their performance.
20. Even the way their grunting, there's certain trends and you know sometimes, they are counter intuitive, some players play better when they get a little bit angry, when they get a little upset.
21. With the help of artificial intelligence, perhaps getting a little upset will lead to more upsets on the court.


## Officials Urge Evacuation Before Unpredictable Hurricane

1. South Carolina's coast looked serene on Wednesday but the picture may be quite different on Friday morning.
2. Hurricane Florence is expected to be a long-duration high-impact event for much of South Carolina, including areas well inland from the coast.
3. Officials warned coastal residents to leave while they still can because there may not be any help available if they need it after the storm.
4. Florence comes with strong winds that are bound to topple trees, break electric lines and damaged roofs even in places well away from the coast.
5. That's the biggest thing when it comes to hurricanes is worrying about, the wind-driven rain.
6. And what could actually be torn off especially like the bottom part of your roof and whatnot; it doesn't matter.
7. If these power lines are gonna come down, it's gonna be, it's gonna be pretty bad.
8. North Carolina is projected to be the hardest hit, but officials warned that Florence is unpredictable and could still change course.
9. Coastal residents have boarded their homes and took what precautions they could before heading inland.
10. Right now it's anxiety and adrenaline to do what we can.
11. Not really fear because there's not a lot we control at the point, but it's the unknown that we're worried about.
12. They're not knowing what's coming and when will it come and how it'll come.
13. US president Donald Trump said the government is well prepared for the storm.
14. We're ready, we're able, we've got the finest people, I think, anywhere in the world.
15. just two months ago, the Trump administration transferred nearly 10 million dollars from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
16. to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement to help fund the deportation of illegal immigrants.
17. A female official said Wednesday, this will not affect the agency's response to the storm.
18. We have plenty of resources to respond. We have plenty of resources to recover that has not impacted our situation whatsoever.
19. Both FEMA and ICE are part of Department of Homeland Security.
20. and the transfer is legal but critics object to the transfer of funds ride before hurricane season.
